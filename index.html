      <p>Hi! My name is Marie Joyce Tio, but I prefer being called Joyce. I am 19 years old. I recently graduated from Glendale High School in 2016. In high school, I was a 4-year member of Glendale High School Dance/Drill Team, and won multiple national titles.</p>

      <p>On my spare time, I like to sleep in to catch up on rest. I also like to take dance classes with my friends, read, edit music and videos, or code. I enjoy hanging out with friends and trying out new kinds of food. Finally, I also think that writing about myself is harder than coding.</p>
